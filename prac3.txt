Practical No 3A
Aim: Linux Network Analysis and ARP poisoning

Command 1:Tracert www.google.com.

Explaination : Traces the route taken by packets to reach a destination host.
Displays a list of all intermediate routers (hops) between your system and Google, each showing its IP address or domain and the round-trip time (RTT) in milliseconds for 3 attempts. Helps identify where delays or connection issues occur.


Command  2: ping
Explaination : Checks if the target host is reachable and measures response time.
Shows reply messages from Googleâ€™s IP address, time in milliseconds for each packet (latency), and packet loss statistics. At the end, it summarizes minimum, maximum, and average response times.

Command 3 : netstat www.google.com.
Explaination : Displays current network connections, routing tables, and port usage.
Lists all active connections including local and remote IP addresses, ports, and connection state (e.g., ESTABLISHED, LISTENING). Helps monitor open ports and active sessions.

Command 4: ipconfig www.google.com
Explaination : Shows the IP address and network configuration of your computer.
Displays IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway of all active network interfaces. Also includes DNS and DHCP details for troubleshooting network issues.
