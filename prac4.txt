Practical No 4 
Aim : Use NMAP to perform port scanning of various forms-ACK, SYN, FIN,NULL,XMAS
 
Steps: 
(1) Install NMAP. After Installation open command prompt and type "NMAP" to check whether 
NMAP has been properly installed or not. 

(2) ACK -sA(TCP ACK scan) 
it never determines open ports. it is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they 
are stateful or not and which ports are filtered. 
command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org

(3) SYN(Stealth)Scan(-sS) 
SYN scan is the default and the most popular scan option for good reason. it can be performed 
quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive 
firewalls. 
command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org 

(4) FIN Scan(-sF) 
sets just the TCP FIN bit. 
Command: nmap -sF -T4 para 192.168.1.27

(5) NULL Scan(-sN) 
Does not sets any bits(TCP flag header is 0) 
command: nmap -sN -p 22 scanme.nmap.org

(6) XMAS Scan(-sX) 
Sets the FIN, PSH, AND URG FLAGS, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
